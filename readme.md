Ownership:
Business partnerships â€“ an arrangement where two or more individuals share the ownership of a business. There are two main types of partnership: general partnerships and limited partnerships. In a general partnership all partners are personally responsible for the business, meaning they are liable for any losses or debts with their personal income or wealth if necessary.
